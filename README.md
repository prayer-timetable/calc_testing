# Flutter channels

flutter channel stable
flutter channel beta
flutter channel master

flutter upgrade

# Flutter run

flutter run --profile
flutter run --release
flutter run --profile -d 'LLD L31'

# Flutter packages

flutter packages get
flutter --no-color upgrade
flutter doctor --verbose

### (upgrade packages)

flutter pub upgrade

### (or)

flutter packages upgrade

# Flutter build

## (android: release bundle)

flutter build appbundle

## (android: release apk) (The flutter build command defaults to --release.)

flutter build apk --split-per-abi
flutter build apk --release --target-platform=android-arm64

(Removing the --split-per-abi flag results in a fat APK that contains your code compiled for all the target ABIs. Such APKs are larger in size than their split counterparts, causing the user to download native binaries that are not applicable to their deviceâ€™s architecture.)

### (build android directly)

cd android
.\gradlew app:build --stacktrace

## (ios build)

flutter build ios

### (windows android emulator cold boot)
